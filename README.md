# Digital Quantum Simulation of Physical Systems via Trotterization and Advanced Methods

We will study efficient digital simulation of quantum dynamics, i.e., approximating

```math
U(t)=e^{-iHt}
```

for physically motivated Hamiltonians. Accurately simulating time evolution enables computing ground-state energies, response functions, and nonequilibrium dynamics in chemistry and condensed matter. While product-formula (Trotter–Suzuki) methods are straightforward and hardware-friendly, state-of-the-art approaches (LCU, QSP) offer superior asymptotic precision scaling. Our project targets a technically honest, end-to-end comparison anchored in \emph{implementations} and \emph{quantitative} evaluation on small instances.
